public class PopUp : MonoBehaviour
{
    // fast and simple
    // set text
    // grow and disappear...
    // problem is right now they live longer than enemy.
    // do it like with explosions, use same event
    
    
    // depth needs percentage when killed
    // and extra method for tutorial to update
    // probably best to have a script for that, can use pop up prefab, set position and value every frame
    // for depth drone use two! one immediatly when shot, the other one like everything else on explosion
